# WebScraping
Various web scraping scripts

## Diner Scraper
Old scraping script I wrote to grab a list of New Jersey diners from an old website.
I need to clean up the code and update the methods.

## QuickChek Scraper
Goes through the [six pages of QuickChek locations](http://quickchek.com/StoresList/List/3097/1) and scrapes them into
a spatial PostgreSQL database. Bing used for geocoding.
