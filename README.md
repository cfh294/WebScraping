# WebScraping
Various web scraping scripts

## [Diner Scraper](https://github.com/cfh294/WebScraping/tree/master/Diner%20Scraper)
Old scraping script I wrote to grab a list of New Jersey diners from an [old website](http://njdiners.com/cgi-bin/listing.cgi?ALL).
I need to clean up the code and update the methods.

## [QuickChek Scraper](https://github.com/cfh294/WebScraping/tree/master/QuickChek%20Scraper)
Goes through the [six pages of QuickChek locations](http://quickchek.com/StoresList/List/3097/1) and scrapes them into
a spatial PostgreSQL database. Bing used for geocoding.
